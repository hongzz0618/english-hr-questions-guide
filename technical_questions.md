## Technical Questions

### Question 1: Can you explain a technical project you've worked on recently?

**Example Response:**  
"In my previous role, I led the migration from a monolithic architecture to 20 microservices. I also implemented a comprehensive monitoring system with real-time alerts, dashboards, and batch processes for error reporting, ensuring high system uptime and quick incident resolution. The project involved using Node.js, TypeScript, Serverless Framework, and Terraform across separate repositories for APIs and infrastructure. I guided the team by breaking the project into smaller tasks, mentoring teammates, and ensuring effective collaboration for future scalability and improvements."

### Question 2: How do you approach debugging a complex issue?

**Example Response:**  
"My process involves breaking the issue into smaller parts to isolate the root cause. I start by reviewing logs and replicating the problem in a test environment. Then, I use debugging tools and systematically test hypotheses until the issue is resolved."

### Question 3: How do you stay updated with the latest trends in technology?

**Example Response:**  
"I follow top YouTubers, subscribe to blogs, and attend webinars to stay updated with the latest technology trends."
