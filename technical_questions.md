## Technical Questions

### Question 1: Can you explain a technical project you've worked on recently?

**Example Response:**  
"In my previous role, I led the migration from a monolithic architecture to 20 microservices. I also implemented a comprehensive monitoring system with real-time alerts, dashboards, and batch processes for error reporting, ensuring high system uptime and quick incident resolution. The project involved using Node.js, TypeScript, Serverless Framework, and Terraform across separate repositories for APIs and infrastructure. I guided the team by breaking the project into smaller tasks, mentoring teammates, and ensuring effective collaboration for future scalability and improvements."

### Question 2: How do you approach debugging a complex issue?

**Example Response:**  
"My process involves breaking the issue into smaller parts to isolate the root cause. I start by reviewing logs and replicating the problem in a test environment. Then, I use debugging tools and systematically test hypotheses until the issue is resolved."

### Question 3: How do you stay updated with the latest trends in technology?

**Example Response:**  
"I follow top YouTubers, subscribe to blogs, and attend webinars to stay updated with the latest technology trends."

### Question 4: What is Node.js and why is it commonly used for backend development?

**Example Response:**  
"Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It's widely used for backend development because itâ€™s non-blocking and event-driven, which allows it to handle many requests simultaneously. This makes it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps or APIs that need to process many I/O operations without slowing down."

### Question 5: How does AWS Lambda work, and what are its main benefits?

**Example Response:**  
"AWS Lambda is a serverless service that lets you run code without managing servers. You upload your code, and Lambda automatically handles scaling based on incoming requests. Its key benefits are cost efficiency (you only pay for compute time), automatic scaling, and no server management. Lambda is perfect for event-driven tasks like API requests, file uploads, or database triggers."

### Question 6: What is the best architecture for small Node.js applications using AWS?

**Example Response:**  
"For small Node.js apps, a serverless architecture is often the best choice. Using AWS Lambda with API Gateway allows you to run code in response to HTTP requests without managing servers. This setup automatically scales based on traffic, and combined with services like DynamoDB for storage and S3 for files, it offers a cost-effective and low-maintenance solution ideal for small apps."
